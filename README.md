# SCReeD Platform Overview 

<p align="justify">
SCReeD is a platform purposefully designed for sharing cybersecurity research data, including, but not limited to cybersecurity datasets generated by CSCRC research projects. For sharing cyber-datasets, general-purpose dataset sharing platforms are not ideal, and often not suitable, due to many reasons, such as the data sensitivity, volume, complexity, and wide range of file formats and serialisations typical to cybersecurity research datasets; also they can be authentic, synthetic, or hybrid, with different potential applications. In addition, a variety of audiences should be considered when sharing cybersecurity datasets, and all these require different levels of access, whether for CSCRC partners, Australian researchers, Australian industry practitioners, 5 Eyes researchers, the EU, or the world, which makes access control crucial in this application—compared to having only the option to share datasets with the general public, which is what many general-purpose/domain-independent dataset sharing platforms focus on.

The data captured in cybersecurity research datasets can be beneficial not only to the academic community, but also the industry in terms of adding new functionalities to, and test existing capabilities of, software tools; evaluating analytic performance of tools; assessing IT infrastructures’ vulnerability; identifying new types of cyberthreats, etc.
